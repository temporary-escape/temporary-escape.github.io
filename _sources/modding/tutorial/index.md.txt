# Tutorial

The following content is a tutorial on creating mods for the Temporary Escape game.

**Modding allows you to change how the game behaves.** For example:

* Adding in new entity types
* Overwriting or adding new textures, models, icons, turrets, ships, sounds, etc.
* Adding custom scripted behavior to entities
* Custom missions and campaigns
* Changing an existing behavior by overwriting event handlers
* And much more!

```{note}
**You do not need to set up a C++ development environment!**

The modding works out of the box. All you need is a simple text editor (no, not Microsoft Office!).
There are no packaging steps required. You work on the files directly!
```
