# Class Vector2

**Module:** `require("engine")`

A simple 2D vector class of float type

------------
## Constructors

List of constructors that will create an instance of `Vector2`.

### new()

Default constructor that initializes the vector to [0, 0]

### new(x, y)

Parametrized constructor that initializes the vector to [x, y]

**Parameters:**

* `x: number` - The x component
* `y: number` - The y component

------------
## Member Functions

List of **member** functions within the table `Vector2`.
These functions need to be called using the colon symbol on some instance of `Vector2`.

### distance(other)

Calculates a distance to some other vector

**Parameters:**

* `other: Vector2` - The other vector to get distance to

### rotate(angle)

Returns a new vector that is rotated by some angle

**Parameters:**

* `angle: Angle` - in radians

------------
## Fields

List of fields within the table `Vector2`.
These variables belong to this class and can be accessed only via an instance of this class.

### x: number

### y: number
