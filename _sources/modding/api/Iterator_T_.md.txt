## Member Functions

List of **member** functions within the table `Iterator<T>`.
These functions need to be called using the colon symbol on some instance of `Iterator<T>`.

### next()

Retrieves the next value

**Returns:** `bool` - True if there is some value to read or false if this is end of the seek

```{warning}
This function must be called first before trying to read the value or the key.
```
